    "## Database\n",
    "\n",
    "**Databases:** A database is a structured repository or collection of data that is stored and retrieved electronically for use in applications. Data can be stored, updated, or deleted from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database Management System (DBMS):** The software used to access the database by the user and application is the database management system. Check out these few links describing a DBMS in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "How to do **relational data modeling** by focusing on normalization, denormalization,fact/dimension tables, and different schema models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Modeling**\n",
    "1. Process to support business and user applications \n",
    "2. Gather Requirements \n",
    "3. Conceptual Data Modeling \n",
    "4. Logical Data Modeling \n",
    "5. Physical Data Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about Data Modeling\n",
    "1. **Data Organization:** The organization of the data for your applications is extremely important and makes everyone's life easier.\n",
    "2. **Use cases:** Having a well thought out and organized data model is critical to how that data can later be used. Queries that could have been straightforward and simple might become complicated queries if data modeling isn't well thought out.\n",
    "3. **Starting early:** Thinking and planning ahead will help you be successful. This is not something you want to leave until the last minute.\n",
    "4. **Iterative Process:** Data modeling is not a fixed process. It is iterative as new requirements and data are introduced. Having flexibility will help as new information becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ques:** Why can't everything be stored in a giant Excel spreadsheet?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** There are limitations to the amount of data that can be stored in an Excel sheet. So, a database helps organize the elements into tables - rows and columns, etc. Also reading and writing operations on a large scale is not possible with an Excel sheet, so it's better to use a database to handle most business functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ques:** Does data modeling happen before you create a database, or is it an iterative process?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** It's definitely an iterative process. Data engineers continually reorganize, restructure, and optimize data models to fit the needs of the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ques:** How is data modeling different from machine learning modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Machine learning includes a lot of data wrangling to create the inputs for machine learning models, but data modeling is more about how to structure data to be used by different people within an organization. You can think of data modeling as the process of designing data and making it available to machine learning engineers, data scientists, business analytics, etc., so they can make use of it easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relational Database\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relational Model** \n",
    "This model organizes data into one or more tables (or \"relations\") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Generally, each table represents one \"entity type\" (such as customer or product).\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the language used across almost all relational database system for querying and maintaining the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Basics** \n",
    "1. **Database/Schema** is collection of Tables \n",
    "2. **Tables/Relation** A group of rows sharing the same labeled elements E.g. Customers \n",
    "3. **Columns/Attribute** are Labeled element E.g. Name, email, city \n",
    "4. **Rows/Tuple** is a single item E.g. Amanda, jdoe@xyc.com, NYC \n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance of Relational Databases:**\n",
    "1. **Standardization of data model:** Once your data is transformed into the rows and columns format, your data is standardized and you can query it with SQL\n",
    "2. **Flexibility in adding and altering tables:** Relational databases gives you flexibility to add tables, alter tables, add and remove data.\n",
    "3. **Data Integrity:** Data Integrity is the backbone of using a relational database.\n",
    "4. **Structured Query Language (SQL):** A standard language can be used to access the data with a predefined language.\n",
    "5. **Simplicity :** Data is systematically stored and modeled in tabular format.\n",
    "6. **Intuitive Organization:** The spreadsheet format is intuitive but intuitive to data modeling in relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Using a Relational Database**\n",
    "1. **Flexibility for writing in SQL queries:** With SQL being the most common database query language.\n",
    "2. **Modeling the data not modeling queries**\n",
    "3. **Ability to do JOINS**\n",
    "4. **Ability to do aggregations and analytics**\n",
    "5. **Secondary Indexes available :** You have the advantage of being able to add another index to help with quick searching.\n",
    "6. **Smaller data volumes:** If you have a smaller data volume (and not big data) you can use a relational database for its simplicity.\n",
    "7. **ACID Transactions:** Allows you to meet a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, and thus maintain data integrity.\n",
    "8. **Easier to change to business requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When Not to Use a Relational Database**\n",
    "1. **Have large amounts of data:** Relational Databases are not distributed databases and because of this they can only scale vertically by adding more storage in the machine itself. You are limited by how much you can scale and how much data you can store on one machine. You cannot add more machines like you can in NoSQL databases.\n",
    "2. **Need to be able to store different data type formats:** Relational databases are not designed to handle unstructured data.\n",
    "3. **Need high throughput -- fast reads:** While ACID transactions bring benefits, they also slow down the process of reading and writing data. If you need very fast reads and writes, using a relational database may not suit your needs.\n",
    "4. **Need a flexible schema:** Flexible schema can allow for columns to be added that do not have to be used by every row, saving disk space.\n",
    "5. **Need high availability:** The fact that relational databases are not distributed (and even when they are, they have a coordinator/worker architecture), they have a single point of failure. When that database goes down, a fail-over to a backup system occurs and takes time.\n",
    "6. **Need horizontal scalability:** Horizontal scalability is the ability to add more machines or nodes to a system to increase performance and space for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **ACID Transactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors or power failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Atomicity:** The whole transaction is processed or nothing is processed. A commonly cited example of an atomic transaction is money transactions between two bank accounts. The transaction of transferring money from one account to the other is made up of two operations. First, you have to withdraw money in one account, and second you have to save the withdrawn money to the second account. An atomic transaction, i.e., when either all operations occur or nothing occurs, keeps the database in a consistent state. This ensures that if either of those two operations (withdrawing money from the 1st account or saving the money to the 2nd account) fail, the money is neither lost nor created. Source Wikipedia for a detailed description of this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistency:** Only transactions that abide by constraints and rules are written into the database, otherwise the database keeps the previous state. The data should be correct across all rows and tables. Check out additional information about consistency on Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Isolation:** Transactions are processed independently and securely, order does not matter. A low level of isolation enables many users to access the data simultaneously, however this also increases the possibilities of concurrency effects (e.g., dirty reads or lost updates). On the other hand, a high level of isolation reduces these chances of concurrency effects, but also uses more system resources and transactions blocking each other. Source: Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "**Durability:** Completed transactions are saved to database even in cases of system failure. A commonly cited example includes tracking flight seat bookings. So once the flight booking records a confirmed seat booking, the seat remains booked even if a system failure occurs. Source: Wikipedia"

    "- The following link [Cassandra Documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlIntro.html) has in-depth about the Apache Cassandra Data Model, how Cassandra reads, writes, updates, and deletes data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CAP Theorem:** A theorem in computer science that states it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. \n",
    "1. **Consistency:** Every read from the database gets the latest (and correct) piece of data or an error\n",
    "2. **Availability:** Every request is received and a response is given -- without a guarantee that the data is the latest update\n",
    "3. **Partition Tolerance:** The system continues to work regardless of losing network connectivity between nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ques:** What does the network look like? Can you share any examples?  \n",
    "**Answer:** In Apache Cassandra every node is connected to every node -- it's peer to peer database architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ques:** Is data deployment strategy an important element of data modeling in Apache Cassandra?  \n",
    "**Answer:** Deployment strategies are a great topic, but have very little to do with data modeling. Developing deployment strategies focuses on determining how many clusters to create or determining how many nodes are needed. These are topics generally covered under database architecture, database deployment and operations, which we will not cover in this lesson. Here is a useful link to learn more about it for Apache Cassandra. In general, the size of your data and your data model can affect your deployment strategies. You need to think about how to create a cluster, how many nodes should be in that cluster, how to do the actual installation. More information about deployment strategies can be found on this [DataStax](https://docs.datastax.com/en/dse-planning/doc/) documentation page\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ques:** What type of companies use Apache Cassandra?  \n",
    "**Answer:** All kinds of companies. For example, Uber uses Apache Cassandra for their entire backend. Netflix uses Apache Cassandra to serve all their videos to customers. Good use cases for NoSQL (and more specifically Apache Cassandra) are :\n",
    "- Transaction logging (retail, health care)\n",
    "- Internet of Things (IoT)\n",
    "- Time series data\n",
    "- Any workload that is heavy on writes to the database (since Apache Cassandra is optimized for writes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ques:** Is Eventual Consistency in ACID?  \n",
    "**Answer:** Much has been written about how Consistency is interpreted in the ACID principle and the CAP theorem. Consistency in the ACID principle refers to the requirement that only transactions that abide by constraints and database rules are written into the database, otherwise the database keeps previous state. In other words, the data should be correct across all rows and tables. However, consistency in the CAP theorem refers to every read from the database getting the latest piece of data or an error. [ACID vs CAP](https://www.voltdb.com/blog/2015/10/disambiguating-acid-cap/)\n",
    " \n",
    "**Ques:** Which of these combinations is desirable for a production system - Consistency and Availability, Consistency and Partition Tolerance, or Availability and Partition Tolerance?   \n",
    "**Answer:** As the CAP Theorem Wikipedia entry says, \"The CAP theorem implies that in the presence of a network partition, one has to choose between consistency and availability.\" So there is no such thing as Consistency and Availability in a distributed database since it must always tolerate network issues. You can only have Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CP) or Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP). Remember, relational and non-relational databases do different things, and that's why most companies have both types of database systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ques:** Does Cassandra meet just Availability and Partition Tolerance in the CAP theorem?  \n",
    "**Answer:** According to the CAP theorem, a database can actually only guarantee two out of the three in CAP. So supporting Availability and Partition Tolerance makes sense, since Availability and Partition Tolerance are the biggest requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ques:** If Apache Cassandra is not built for consistency, won't the analytics pipeline break?  \n",
    "**Answer:** If I am trying to do analysis, such as determining a trend over time, e.g., how many friends does John have on Twitter, and if you have one less person counted because of \"eventual consistency\" (the data may not be up-to-date in all locations), that's OK. In theory, that can be an issue but only if you are not constantly updating. If the pipeline pulls data from one node and it has not been updated, then you won't get it. Remember, in Apache Cassandra it is about Eventual Consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ques:** Would Apache Cassandra be a hindrance for my analytics work? If yes, why?\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, if you are trying to do analysis, such as using GROUP BY statements. Since Apache Cassandra requires data modeling based on the query you want, you can't do ad-hoc queries. However you can add clustering columns into your data model and create new tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distributed Databse**\n",
    "- A distributed database is basically a database that is not limited to one system, it is spread over different sites, i.e, on multiple computers or over a network of computers. \n",
    "- A distributed database system is located on various sites that don’t share physical components. \n",
    "- This may be required when a particular database needs to be accessed by various users globally. \n",
    "- It needs to be managed such that for the users it looks like one single database.\n",
    "- In a distributed database, in order to have high availability, you will need copies of you data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Eventual Consistency:**\n",
    "Over time (if no new changes are made) each copy of the data will be the same, but if there are new changes, the data may be different in different locations. The data may be inconsistent for only milliseconds. There are workarounds in place to prevent getting stale data."

    "\n",
    "- To reduce data redundancy(copies of my data) and increase data integrity(Data I get from database is the correct answer). \n",
    "- Normalization is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and increase data integrity. \n",
    "- Objectives of Normal Form:\n",
    "    - To free the database from unwanted insertions, updates, & deletion dependencies\n",
    "    - To reduce the need for refactoring the database as new types of data are introduced\n",
    "    - To make the relational model more informative to users\n",
    "    - To make the database neutral to the query statistics  \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **How to reach First Normal Form (1NF):**\n",
    "    - Atomic values: each cell contains unique and single values (No list)\n",
    "    - Be able to add data without altering tables (E.g. Adding column)\n",
    "    - Separate different relations into different tables (E.g. Customer Table and Sales Table)\n",
    "    - Keep relationships between tables together with foreign keys\n",
    "- **Second Normal Form (2NF):**\n",
    "    - Have reached 1NF\n",
    "    - All columns in the table must rely on the Primary Key (No composite key (We don't want two columns to reach third column))\n",
    "- **Third Normal Form (3NF):**\n",
    "    - Must be in 2nd Normal Form\n",
    "    - No transitive dependencies\n",
    "    - Remember, transitive dependencies you are trying to maintain is that to get from A-> C, you want to avoid going through B.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use 3NF:** When you want to update data, we want to be able to do in just 1 place. We want to avoid updating the table in the Customers Detail table (in the example in the lecture slide).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Denormalization:** Denormalization is trying to increase performance by reducing the number of joins between tables (as joins can be slow). Data integrity will take a bit of a potential hit, as there will be more copies of the data (to reduce JOINS)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Must be done in read heavy workloads to increase performance. \n",
    "- JOINS on the database allow for outstanding flexibility but are extremely slow. If you are dealing with heavy reads on your database, you may want to think about denormalizing your tables.

    "```\n",
    "**UNIQUE**\n",
    "The **UNIQUE** constraint is used to specify that the data across all the rows in one column are unique within the table. The **UNIQUE** constraint can also be used for multiple columns, so that the combination of the values across those columns will be unique within the table. In this latter case, the values within 1 column do not need to be unique.\n",

    "The **PRIMARY KEY** constraint is defined on a single column, and every table should contain a **primary key**. The values in this column uniquely identify the rows in the table. If a group of columns are defined as a primary key, they are called a composite key. That means the combination of values in these columns will uniquely identify the rows in the table. By default, the **PRIMARY KEY** constraint has the unique and not null constraint built into it.\n",
